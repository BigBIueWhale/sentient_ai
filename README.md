# sentient_ai
Just like Bing Chat except there's no user, the AI starts thinking independently.

# Large language models such as GPT 4 already have a better intuition than most humans.
What they're currently missing is:
* Doing things, trial and error, not just text output.
* An independent train of thought.
This thin wrapper over existing large language models unlocks those abilities to create what I claim is a fully conscious AI.
# Not a program
This is more of a philosophical exercise than it is a piece of software.

The evolutionary pressure to keep humans conscious is an agent that decides what to think about and when, because the brain can't think about everything at once.
# Consciousness is the task manager of the brain
* There would be no sentience and no self awareness in humans without an evolutionary pressure to cause and maintain those properties.
* The ideas of self awareness and a "train of thought" are both crucial for human survival.
* What is consciousness if not just a group of useful behaviours in human brains?
# Give Control To The Machines
All that this Python script really does is to allow a large language model to run and debug code on your computer independently of you (you just have to keep pressing ENTER).
# Disclaimers
* This is very dangerous because it could easily create SkyNet 2023
* Currently doesn't actually work very well
